This notebook will be dedicated to further delve into the idea of **fuel efficiency**.
It will serve as an exploration of the feasibility of the project itself, trying to answer questions such as:
1. Will it bring about actual improvements? Will operations benefit from any enhancements resulting from this project?
2. Will any data source be available to develop the idea? Potential resources:
  1. QAR *(Quick Access Recorders)* â†’ these devices gather data throughout the flights so as to later retrieve it via USB (for example) and analyze it on ground.
  2. Google datasets?
  3. [United States Department of Transportation](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/fuel.asp):
3. State-of-the-art solutions:
  1. [JEPPESEN FUEL DASHBOARD](https://ww2.jeppesen.com/flight-and-fuel-optimization/fuel-dashboard-solution-manage-airline-fuel-usage-cost/):
      - **Scalability**: Fuel Dashboard is an agnostic tool that works with operators of all sizes and fleet types.
      - **Visibility**: Transparency of data quality means accurate savings opportunities, allowing you to confidently prioritize and execute fuel initiatives
      - **Advanced analytics**: Enhanced analytics track more than 600 unique parameters per flight. We use actual binary QAR data for the whole flight to reach higher fidelity in calculations
      - **Enhanced optimization**: Unique capabilities that allow you to compare your actual performance to plan, while also comparing your plan to an optimized flight plan
      - **Focus**: Operationally focused with dedicated interfaces such as the Pilot Insight iOS app to support your internal communications and fuel program uptake
