This notebook will be dedicated to further delve into the idea of **fuel efficiency**.
It will serve as an exploration of the feasibility of the project itself, trying to answer questions such as:
1. Will it bring about actual improvements? Will operations benefit from any enhancements resulting from this project?
2. Will any data source be available to develop the idea? Potential resources:
  1. QAR *(Quick Access Recorders)* â†’ these devices gather data throughout the flights so as to later retrieve it via USB (for example) and analyze it on ground.
