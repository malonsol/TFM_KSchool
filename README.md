Repository dedicated exclusively to the Master's Final Thesis

In this repository I will gather all the relevant information to the project.

## Preliminary ideas
**1) Aviation industry:**
  - Predictive aircraft maintenance
  - Fuel consumption optimization:
    - In-house solutions based on company data → companies will highly likely be reluctant to sharing data
    - Southwest/GE Aviation “secret recipe” of fuel consumption optimization → use its flight analytics system to improve fuel consumption for its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s https://www.ge.com/news/reports/big-data-industrial-internet-can-help-southwest-save-100-million-fuel?utm_source=datafloq&utm_medium=ref&utm_campaign=datafloq
      - GE’s Flight Efficiency Services (FES) unit
      - Industrial Internet – a digital network that connects machines like jet engines to software and the data cloud
      - With airline profit margins often at just 2 percent of operating expenses, being fuel-efficient is critical → Fuel amounts to more than 20 percent of the average airline’s operating expenses
      - Using FES to manage fuel can reduce annual fuel costs by as much as 2 percent → For example, in 2014, Southwest spent $5.27 billion to buy fuel, meaning the FES system could identify potential fuel-cost savings of up to $105 million each year.
  - AI and big data anayltics → real-time predictive pricing offers

    * Revenue management → Understanding traveler demands and pricing flights : city pairs, time of the week/day, holidays, seasonality, events, demographics, fuel price...
    * Aviation Rank by *predict HQ* matches historical flight bookings with event data to reveal how much a given event may affect traveler demand
    * Demand for food items in cabin depending on the route (*easyjet*)
    * Fuel consumption optimization:
      - Aviation industry contributed 2.4% of the global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel in 2018 → carbon emissions increased globally 32% in the past five years
      - On the same same year, airlines spent 23.5% of total expenses on jet fuel → accurately predict how much fuel is needed (*Southwest Airlines*)
        * 8 predictive models, including time series algorithms and neural networks
        * The system could produce 9600 fuel consumption forescasts for each month and each airport the carrier flies to
        * Previously, roughly 1200 analysis a month, taking up to three days to make one → New solution: 5 minutes, and much more accurate predictions
    * Boarding and checking bags with facial recognition
    * Prparing a plane for the next flight → turnaround: time between an airplane landing and the next departure
     - In 2018, US passenger airlines were losing an average of \$74.20 per minute due to delays (US DoT: 5.8% time of all delayed flights
     - *assaia* startup invented *The Apron AI*: software that processes video streams from airfields using image recognition to monitor how the airplane is being prepared for the next flight (fueling, cargo loading, catering delivery...)
     - *Lufthansa's ZeroG* subsidiary for AI initiatives
