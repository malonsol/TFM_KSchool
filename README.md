Repository dedicated exclusively to the Master's Final Thesis

In this repository I will gather all the relevant information to the project.

## Preliminary ideas
**1) Aviation industry:**
  - Predictive aircraft maintenance
  - Fuel consumption optimization:
    - In-house solutions based on company data → companies will highly likely be reluctant to sharing data
    - Southwest/GE Aviation “secret recipe” of fuel consumption optimization → use its flight analytics system to improve fuel consumption for its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s https://www.ge.com/news/reports/big-data-industrial-internet-can-help-southwest-save-100-million-fuel?utm_source=datafloq&utm_medium=ref&utm_campaign=datafloq
      - GE’s Flight Efficiency Services (FES) unit
      - Industrial Internet – a digital network that connects machines like jet engines to software and the data cloud
      - With airline profit margins often at just 2 percent of operating expenses, being fuel-efficient is critical → Fuel amounts to more than 20 percent of the average airline’s operating expenses
      - Using FES to manage fuel can reduce annual fuel costs by as much as 2 percent → For example, in 2014, Southwest spent $5.27 billion to buy fuel, meaning the FES system could identify potential fuel-cost savings of up to $105 million each year.
  - AI and big data anayltics → real-time predictive pricing offers


## Building up your Data Scientist portfolio
[*Article: How to Build a Data Science Portfolio*](https://news.codecademy.com/how-to-build-a-data-science-portfolio/)
- Talking to Data Scientists
- Reading Job Postings of Your Dream Job → Make sure to find multiple options you are interested in
- Find a Dataset to Address a Problem You’re Curious About:

  1.See other people’s data science projects:
    - [Towards Data Science blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
    - [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
    
  2.Generate project ideas is to find datasets that interest you:
    - [Google Dataset Search Tool](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
    - [Reddit Datasets Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)
    - [Awesome Github Repository With a List of Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)
- “Complete” Your Project and Seek Feedback:
  - Github Repository containing a Readme file
  - Discuss the “business problem” you are trying to address
  - Include comments in your Jupyter notebooks detailing your thought process
  - Be consistent with the format (colors, etc.) in your visualizations
  - Regularly commit and push changes to your Github repository as you are working
