Repository dedicated exclusively to the Master's Final Thesis

In this repository I will gather all the relevant information to the project.

## Preliminary ideas
**1) Aviation industry:**
  - Predictive aircraft maintenance
  - Fuel consumption optimization:
    - In-house solutions based on company data → companies will highly likely be reluctant to sharing data
    - Southwest/GE Aviation “secret recipe” of fuel consumption optimization → use its flight analytics system to improve fuel consumption for its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s https://www.ge.com/news/reports/big-data-industrial-internet-can-help-southwest-save-100-million-fuel?utm_source=datafloq&utm_medium=ref&utm_campaign=datafloq
    - AI and big data anayltics → real-time predictive pricing offers
