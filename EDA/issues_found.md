1. B43_inventory:
  - Too many MANUFACTURER values, many of which are essentially the same: compliacated cleaning.
  - Same issue with MODEL values, but with a whole lot more different values.
  
    **QUESTION:** Is it worth it to spend much time cleaning it? Should I stick with most used models (e.g. B737, A320, etc.) and evaluate carrriers which only use those?
