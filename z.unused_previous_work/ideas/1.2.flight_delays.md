# Flight Delays

### Potential questions to answer:

- When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
- Do older planes suffer more delays?
- How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
- How well does weather predict plane delays?
- Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?‚Äù
