## Description

A light web-based application under the name of ***CLEAR SKY*** was both developed and deployed using Streamlit. The main purpose of this service is to ease airlines workload concerning flight planning operations.

I happily encourage everybody to have a look and play with it freely!

Of course, please do not hesitate to contact me should any doubt may arise during tests:
